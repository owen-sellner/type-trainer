# Type Trainer
## Project Motivation
For this project, I had two main goals. First, I wanted to practice developing in Vanilla JS to get a better understanding of DOM Manipulation. Second, I want to create a typing game that does not require the user to manually restart the game and would allow them to continuously keep typing. 

## Project Description
The project was developed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. To start the game the user clicks on the textbox and can start typing. For better readability spaces are represented using the space bar icon but can be typed as normal. If at any time the user wants to pause the game they can click anywhere on the screen excluding the textbox. For statistics, the user is provided both Word per Minute (WPM) and accuracy. Both statistics are updated after the user completes typing a quote. The WPM is calculated using the Characters per Minute divided by five and the accuracy is the percentage of correctly typed characters divided by the total number of characters. Also, the accuracy is calculated as an average between the accuracy of the current quote and the accuracy of the previous quotes the user has typed. In addition, the user can control whether there are capital letters or punctuation included in the quotes using the checkboxes at the top left of the textbox.
